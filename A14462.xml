            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For, as the firſte ſorte vſurpe a greate tyranny ouer the Churche, and ouer the Miniſterie of the ſame, lyke vnto that of the Antichriſte, who hath plucked to hym ſelfe the authoritie to diſpoſe of the Churche at hys pleaſure: in lyke maner this laſte ſorte do wronge to them ſelues, and do frame and eſtabliſhe a derye daungerous tyrannye, both agaynſt them ſelues, &amp; agaynſte the whole Church, and do confirme Antechriſte in the poſſeſſion whiche he hathe all ready vſurped ouer them. For albeit that a iudge, before he gyue ſentence, and before he wyll execute the ſame, do aſke the aduiſe and counſell of hys aſſiſtauntes, yet doth he not gyue hys iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mente accordynge to theyr ſentences, vntil he haue wel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and vnderſtood them.

But a iudge, hathe farre other autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and greater charge, the whiche Pilate dyd very well knowe. And therefore he woulde not condemne Ieſus Chriſte vpon the onely reporte of the Iewes, when they had brought hym vnto hym, all ready condemned in theyr Counſell: nor was forthwith preſte to commaunde hym to be executed as an euill doer, accordynge to their deſire, but did diligently enquire of the cauſes, for the which they would haue hym to be condemned: gyuing them playnely to vnderſtande, that he woulde not be their hangemen, but woulde do the office of a Iudge, whiche is duely to examine the cauſe. And if he ſee the ſentence of hys aſſiſtauntes to be vniuſte, he oughte not to folowe it, but to reiecte it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the authoritie that God hath gyuen hym: and he ought to put in vſe that, whiche is written in the lawe to <note place="margin">Exod, 10</note> that ſame purpoſe.

And therefore the ceremoniall lawes haue a greate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, with the poſitiue lawes: for as the ciuil lawes are gyuen for conſeruation of the ciuill policie, and to helpe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to leade men to yelde that obedience vnto God, whiche they owe vnto him: euen in lyke ſort the ceremonial lawes do ſerue to entertayne the Eccleſiaſtique policie, &amp; to frame men to the true ſeruice of God. But for that the meanes by the whiche this may be done, may be diuerſe, and that ſome of them may be mete for ſome tyme, in certayne places and for certayne people, whiche ſhoulde not be mete for others: God hath therfore left it at libertie, prouided that the rule which I touched before, be therin alway obſerued. For theſe thynges are in this reſpecte as thynges indifferent, and the chaunge that in them happeneth, doth not procede of God, ne yet of any inconſtancie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is in his will, but of our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and inconſtancie, ſauyng onely that God of hys good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, doth willingly condiſcend to our rudeneſſe and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But there is an other reaſon in his wil which he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be eternall, and in the thinges that he hath once de clared to be for euer good or euill, and that depende of the ſame, and are not onely as entries as are the ceremonies, for in ſuch matters he neuer changed any thing, nor neuer made law, by the whiche he allowed Idolatrie, blaſphemie, adultery, murder, &amp; other lyke wickedneſſe, whiche he hath once forbidden by his law, whiche is nothyng els, but a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of his eternall will, and of the naturall law, which is naturally imprinted in the hartes of men, by the whiche he hath put in them an impreſſion of his eternal will, which can neuer be cleane plucked out.

For it is a thing moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, that ſuche men wil neuer agree to haue a councell holden, vnleſſe they know it to be for their profitte, and that they may there rule at their pleaſure, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to do in their Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Trent.

For allbeit that many dwell ſtill in their olde ſkins, yet do they their duety, for their part. They glorifie in their offices, they do aſſure &amp; entertayne the good in peace. They are a means to make ſtrong thoſe that are weake, and do diſcharge their

And therfore I deny not but that of lawful Councels, there commeth often tymes great profite, for a certaine tyme, for the pollice and outward peace of the Church: but I ſay that they ar not ſufficient thorowly to appeaſe the troubles y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are in Chriſtendome, and to edifie perfectly the inwarde man, &amp; to quiet the conſcience in deede, and to gyue it true quietnes and aſſuraunce, if nothyng els.

For the doctrine of the law is an vnderſtanding and knowledge of the will of God, which is as it were borne with man in his creation, in ſo muche as God hath printed it in hys hart, and hath endued him with that grace, as with others wherewith he hath endued him, when he did create and make him to hys image and likenes. But forſomuch as it hath bene great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly darkened and blotted by meanes of ſinne, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward came into the world: we muſt of force come to the vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtanding and knowledge of the Goſpel, which is not na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural, as is that of the lawe, nor of the benefit of our fyrſt creation, as is this here: but of that of the regeneracion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempcion, and iuſtification, which is reuealed vnto vs by the ſonne of God, who brought it vnto vs from the boſome of the father.

And ſo he is deliuered from the lawe, as touching the condemnacion and curſſe wherewith ſhe threatneth all tranſgreſſors. Therfore S.

For Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt taking vpon him the curſſe which they had deſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued, hath alſo ſatiſfied the iuſtice of God for them, &amp; payde the debt which the law required.

Therefore he eſteemeth <note place="margin">i. Tim. ii. i. Cor. i. ii</note> them for iuſt. And in conſideracion of this great benefitte, Ieſus Chriſt is called by S.

For the iuſt man being ioyned vnto God, and beyng made partaker of his iuſtice and nature, he is a lawe vnto himſelfe. For that that he hath the lawe of God prynted in his hart by the meane of that image of God, vnto the which
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19825:108"/> he is made like. Wherfore, he kepeth hym ſelfe from euerye thyng that he knoweth to be contrarye to the wyll of God, and employeth hym to euerye thyng that he knoweth to be pleaſaunt and agreable vnto him, not with ſuche a harte &amp; mynd as doth a hyreling, which doth nothing but in hope of hys hyre: or as a man of an euyll mynde whiche refray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not from the euyl that he would wyllinglye doo, but onely for that that the puniſhment whych he feareth, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hym from it. For ſuche men doo nothing neither for the honour of God, nor yet for hys iuſtice, who of hys na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is woorthye to be loued and honoured, although there were no rewarde for thoſe that honour hym, nor punyſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them that offende hym, and tranſgreſſe agaynſte hys holye ordinaunces. <hi>T.</hi> Why doo they then doo it? <hi>D.</hi> They doo it onelye for the loue of them ſelues. But the iuſt man doth it to honour God, and for the loue that hee beareth to hys iuſtice, in ſuch ſorte, as he cannot otherwiſe doo, althoughe there were no puniſhment at all ordayned for the tranſgreſſours, nor yet reward for the obedient, as we ſee manye examples thereof among men. For an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man doth not keepe hym ſelfe from being a theefe and a murtherer, for feare of the puniſhment that is appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſuche offences, but for that he loueth vertue, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vice. Therefore, althoughe that ſuche vyces ſhould not be puniſhed at all, yet would he neuer the ſooner doo them. And therefore the lawe ordayned for theeues and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, is not ordayned for hym, nor maketh hym ſubiect at all vnto it, as is the theefe and murtherer: for ſo muche as wythout it he doth of hym ſelfe that which the lawe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
